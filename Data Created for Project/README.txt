***General Introduction*** 

This analyzed data is for domestic change (DC), the gross synergy and Contributions to gross synergy for the economic and environmental Sustinable Development Goals (SDGs).

***Description of the data in this data set***  

1. dc_average_economic_indicators.csv
This dataset is the average of the domestic change across every year for each of the economic SDGs. The domestic averages are for ever country in the group seven (G7). 

2. dc_average_environment_indicators.csv
This dataset is the average of the domestic change across every year for each of the environmental SDGs. The domestic averages are for ever country in the group seven (G7). 

3. economic_gross_synergy_g7.csv
This dataset contains time series Gross Synergy values for the economic SDGs of the G7 countries. 

4. environment_gross_synergy_g7.csv
This dataset contains time series Gross Synergy values for the environmental SDGs of the G7 countries. 

5. contributions_to_synergy.xlsx
This dataset containts time series contribution values of each country of G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America) to the overall gross synergy synergy. These datasets were used to generate the heatmaps, by simply using each SDG indicator as the key and countries as values. The datasets were normalized between -100% to 100% for the heatmaps. 

6. contributions_per_indicator_g7.xlsx
This dataset contains positive proportion of contributions to the gross synergy of economic and environmental SDG indicators by G7 countries. Each column represents the G7 country, and each observation represents the positive proportion of a single country to an SDG indicator. These proportions were found by counting the number of positive contributions for all years for a single SDG indicator. 
The contributions datasets and the formula below was used to get this dataset. 

Positive Proportion of Contribution = number of positive contributions throughout the year / total number of contributions throughout the years

7. yearly_contributions_by_g7.xlsx
These two datasets contain yearly positive proportion of contributions to the gross synergy of economic and environmental SDG indicators by G7 countries. These proportions were found by counting the number of contributions for every single year for all economic and environmental indicators.
The contributions datasets (point 8 and 9 above) and the formula below was used to get this dataset. 

Yearly Positive Proportion of Contribution = number of positive contributions of one year throughout all SDG indicators / total number of SDG indicators
